This program wasn't as difficult as I first imagined the program to be but I did run into a few 
small issues after I thought I was finished and working on testing. My remove marbles functions do 
not seem to remove marbles from the bag array but for some reason will only add to the array. though
it will only add 1 to the number stored rather than the number input. The addition seems to work and
its entirely possible to add a number such as 1 billion. Also upon getting ready to submit the 
assignment I realized that you request a driver file for the program. I will have to schedule a time
with you to go over driver files or set up a tutor appointment to go over them. I thought it was a 
header file but I couldnt find much information on creating a header file that would compile the c++
program. This will be a portion that I need to make up in the future. 

I have included an image file with my initial design and thought process on the program. Its been a 
while since I have programmed anything other than bots so I'm a little rusty in a few areas. Though
in the end building the program felt like riding a bike even though I haven't had any experience
in C++ previously. The program as is should always give the user the current count of marbles, they
can add and quit the program but the subtraction function does not seem to work.
