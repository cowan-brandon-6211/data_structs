These two files are created using various resources both from class and two other websites on building queues. One page discusses using a class to initialize the queue and the properties that are available to the queue elements. Creating the queue was a little more difficult than I imagined. I'm currently a little confused on the difference between an array and a linked list but I will have to ask that in our next meeting.
